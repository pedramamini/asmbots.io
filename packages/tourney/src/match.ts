/**
 * Matches (ISA §5.5): K rounds with seeds `seed, seed + 1, ..., seed + K - 1` and the bot order
 * rotated each round. The match score of a bot is the sum of its round points.
 *
 * Round i places the bots in the order `i mod N, i mod N + 1, ...`, around the list: each bot
 * goes first as often as the others (over N rounds), so the bias of placement order cancels.
 * Seeds wrap at 2^32, as the engine takes a uint32.
 *
 * `iterateMatch` runs one round per step and yields the partial match after each, so the UI and
 * the Durable Object can drive a match, stop it, and resume it from the last partial.
