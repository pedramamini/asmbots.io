/**
 * King of the Hill (ARCHITECTURE §5, PRODUCT_SPEC §5): a hill holds up to `size` entries. A
 * challenger fights every entry, one match of `rounds` rounds each, and its score is the sum of
 * its match points. Every entry's score is the sum of its points over its matches against the
 * other entries, so the field (hill plus challenger) is ranked on equal terms. When the field is
 * over `size`, the lowest entry is pushed off; the scores then drop its matches.
 *
 * The rank orders by score, then age (older stays), then the old board order, with the
 * challenger after the incumbents. So a challenger stays only when it beats the lowest entry.
 * Each entry that stays through a challenge ages by one.
 *
 * The state holds one match summary per pair of entries, keyed by `matchHash`. Re-scoring reads
 * those summaries and never runs a match again. A challenger with the same bytes as an entry
 * (the same `botHash`) replaces that entry: the old entry and its matches go, and the
 * challenger fights the rest with the old entry's age.
 *
 * A melee hill (`settleMelee`) plays one melee of the challenger and every entry instead, and
 * ranks the field by its melee points: the newest melee scores the whole board.
 *
 * The state is plain data (JSON-safe) and the functions on it are pure. `submitToHill` runs one
 * match per step through the caller's runner, so the Durable Object can load bots by id, persist
 * each match, and resume with the matches it has.
