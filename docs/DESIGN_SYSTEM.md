# ASM Bots Design System

Reference: [atxsentinel.com](https://atxsentinel.com), measured 2026-09-21 (screenshots in `docs/ref-atxsentinel-*.png`). The feel: a mission-control console that has been running for years. Dense, monospace, quiet, every pixel earning its place. Data glows; chrome does not.

## 1. Principles

1. **Monospace everywhere.** JetBrains Mono 300..700, self-hosted (woff2 subset), no sans-serif anywhere. Tabular numerals on.
2. **Hex is the native unit.** Addresses are `0x0A1F` (4 uppercase digits). Bytes are `FF`. Never decimal for an address.
3. **Color = identity, brightness = recency, white = now.** Bot hues identify; glow decays with age; the current IP is white. Nothing else competes.
4. **Uppercase, letter-spaced labels; lowercase, calm controls.** Panel titles and nav shout quietly (`0.08em` tracking, 11 px); inputs and selects whisper.
5. **Borders, not shadows.** 1 px hairlines in the border token. No drop shadows except the modal overlay.
6. **The arena is always black.** Regardless of theme, the memory map background is `#000`. It is an instrument.
7. **Motion is information.** 120 ms ease-out for state changes; nothing decorative moves. Reduced-motion respected.

## 2. Tokens

CSS variables on `:root[data-theme="…"]`. Tailwind 4 `@theme` maps them to utilities. The shader receives the same palette as a uniform.

`--accent` draws borders, focus rings, and fills; `--accent-fg` is the accent as text (`text-accent-fg`). They are one color where the accent reads at 4.5:1 as small text; pedurple's `#9146FF` does not on its panels, so its text is a lighter violet; tokyo-night's text is its cyan and dracula's its pink, as Maestro's are; and paper's and catppuccin-latte's text are their darker accents, which hold on the fills. tokyo-night, dracula, nord, and catppuccin-latte take their palettes from Maestro's themes of those names, each token that missed its contrast floor moved toward white (or black, on the light ones) until it holds; nord's surfaces are a step darker than Maestro's for the same reason. catppuccin-latte and paper are the light themes. Accent alphas used as fills: `--accent-10` (0.10), `--accent-25`, `--accent-45`, `--accent-80`. Theme persists in `localStorage.theme`; `prefers-color-scheme: light` defaults to `paper` on first visit, otherwise `sentinel`.

Bot palette (12 hues, per theme file; sentinel shown). Chosen for ≥ 3:1 contrast on black and mutual distinguishability at 4 px cells:

```
#FF5C5C  #FF9F43  #FFD93D  #7CFC00  #00FF88  #2DE2E6
#4CC9F0  #7B7BFF  #B57BFF  #FF6BD6  #FF8FA3  #E0E0E0
```

Bot 13+ wraps with a hatched marker in the roster so two bots never share an unmarked hue.

## 3. Type scale

| Role | Size / line | Weight | Tracking | Case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ticker | 11 / 16 | 500 | 0.04em | as written |
| Brand | 13 / 16 | 700 | 0.12em | UPPER |
| Nav button | 11 / 14 | 500 | 0.08em | UPPER |
| Panel title | 11 / 14 | 600 | 0.10em | UPPER |
| Panel status | 10 / 14 | 400 | 0.10em | UPPER, muted |
| Body | 13 / 20 | 400 | 0 | as written |
| Data cell | 12 / 18 | 400 | 0 | tabular |
| Code | 13 / 20 | 400 | 0 | as written |
| Stat number | 24 / 28 | 300 | -0.01em | tabular |
| Modal title | 18 / 24 | 600 | 0.06em | UPPER |

## 4. Layout grammar (from atxsentinel)

```
┌ ticker ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐  24 px, --panel, hairline bottom
│ ▍LIVE · HILL "MAIN" · dwarf-v3 took #1 · 12,480 cycles →             │
├ header ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤  40 px

└ status ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘  22 px chips: bottom-left status, bottom-center attribution, bottom-right version + fps
```

- **Panel**: `--panel` fill, 1 px `--border`, radius 4, padding 12. Title row: title left (accent), status right (muted). Hairline under the title row.
- **Nav button**: 1 px `--border`, radius 3, padding 4 10, icon 12 px + label. Active: `--accent` border + text + `--accent-10` fill. Hover: `--border-strong`.
- **Segmented control**: bordered pills, 2 px gap, active pill accent-bordered.
- **Input**: `--panel-2` fill, `--border`, `> ` prompt glyph in `--text-dim`, no focus ring, focus = accent border.
- **Chip**: 10 px UPPER, `--panel`, hairline, radius 3, padding 2 8. Semantic variants tint text only.
- **Table**: hairline row separators only, header muted UPPER 10 px, right-align numerics, row hover `--panel-2`.
- **Modal**: centered, `--panel`, `--border-strong`, radius 6, overlay `rgba(0,0,0,0.7)`, Esc and overlay-click dismiss, focus trapped.
- **Toast**: bottom-right stack, 5 s, semantic left stripe 2 px.
- **Skeleton**: `--panel-2` blocks; long loads show the radar-sweep modal (SVG, accent, 2 s rotation).
- **Empty state**: one muted sentence + one accent action. Never an illustration.

## 5. Arena rendering spec

- Grid 256 x 256, cell = 1 byte. Cell size auto-fits the panel; zoom 1x..16x with wheel, pan with drag, `0` resets. Minimap bottom-right of the arena when zoomed.
- Cell fill: `owner == 0 → --arena-bg`. Else bot hue at 0.55 alpha if the byte is non-zero, 0.22 alpha if the byte is zero (owned-but-DAT reads as dim territory, matching "color = identity"). Lattice 1 px `--arena-lattice` at zoom ≥ 4x.
- Write flash: `--arena-write` blended by `exp(-age/220ms)`. Exec trail: `--arena-exec` by `exp(-age/600ms)`. IP: 1 px `--arena-ip` outline plus 2 px glow, one per live process; the front-of-queue process is brighter.
- Death: 300 ms ring ripple in the bot's hue at the death address, then the process outline vanishes. Bot death: the bot's territory desaturates 40% over 800 ms (it stays visible; the dead own what they wrote).
- Spawn: 200 ms outward pulse at the child address.
- Bloom: quarter-res two-pass Gaussian on the emissive channel (IP, trails, flashes only), strength per theme. Scanline + vignette: sentinel/amber/pedurple/ice on, paper off; user toggle in settings.
- Ruler: hex every 0x800 in `--arena-ruler`, bold every 0x1000, left margin 44 px; column ruler top every 0x10 at zoom ≥ 4x.
- Hover: crosshair + tooltip `0x1A2F  7B  add bx, 4  · owned by dwarf-v3 · written 412 cycles ago`.
- 60 fps at 8 bots and 2,000 cycles/frame on an M1 in Chrome; degrade cycles/frame before frame rate.

## 6. Iconography

Lucide icons, 12 px in nav/chips, 16 px in toolbars, stroke 1.75. Semantic set: arena `grid-2x2`, editor `code-2`, tournaments `trophy`, hills `mountain`, stats `chart-column`, docs `book-open`, play `play`, pause `pause`, step `step-forward`, step-back `step-back`, seek `gauge`, theme `palette`, keys `keyboard`, share `link`, verified `shield-check`, source `git-fork` (lucide has no brand marks). No emoji in UI chrome. Bot avatars are 8x8 identicons generated from the bot's bytes hash in its hue.

## 7. Sound (opt-in, default off, persisted)

Tiny synthesized cues via WebAudio, no samples: tick per cycle at low speeds, soft click on write bursts, a low thud on process death, a short falling tone on bot death, a rising three-note on victory. Master volume in settings; `m` mutes.

## 8. Accessibility

WCAG 2.2 AA; axe in Playwright finds no violation on any route in any theme. Contrast, checked in CI by `bun run contrast` over all nine themes: every text token at 4.5:1 on `--bg`, `--panel`, `--panel-2`, and the `--accent-10` fill; `--text-bright` also on `--accent-25` and `--accent-45` (text on those fills is bright: white is now); `--accent` at 3:1 as the focus ring. The accent as text is `--accent-fg`. `--text-dim` is never content: placeholders, the prompt glyph, list markers. A link in running text is underlined. Full keyboard operation: a skip link is the first Tab stop, every Tab stop shows focus (a 1 px accent outline 1 px out, which nothing may clip; inputs and the source turn their border accent), and nothing traps focus (Esc leaves the source). Every part of the page sits in a landmark, and each page has one `h1`. Arena has an ARIA live region summarizing state every 2 s when playing ("cycle 12,480; 3 bots alive; dwarf-v3 leads footprint"). Reduced motion, the system's or the setting's over it, disables bloom pulses, ripples, the ticker scroll, and the coach marks' and dialogs' transitions.

## 9. Voice

Terse, technical, lowercase in controls, uppercase in labels. "8 bots · 41 procs" not "There are 8 bots with 41 processes." Errors name the fix: "jump out of range (+142); use `jmp near` or invert the branch." Empty hill: "no entrants yet. submit a bot →".

## 10. Art

The site's pictures are drawn by code from the machine's own parts, in the theme's tokens, so each one follows the theme with no second copy. Four styles (studies: `docs/art-styles.html` in the parent folder):

| Style | What it is | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Dither plate | 1-bit ordered (Bayer 4 × 4) scenes: the accent, `--text-bright` for a flag or a gleam, 3 px cells (2 px on small plates) with a 1 px gap. Scenes: `footer` (the hills, a flag each for `tiny`, `main`, `melee`, the peaks and the sun seeded by the page's path, so each page's range differs a little), `podium` (three bots on a 1-2-3 podium), `trophy`, `chip`; the section banners `summit` (hills), `bracket` (tournaments), `disk` (bots), `arena` (the arena's setup), `chart` (stats: a bar a day climbing to the right, the older bars dimmer, today's lit at its top); `terminal` (spare: the profile draws charts now), `manual` (the docs home). | The footer, the home page, the championship panel, each section's intro, the docs home |
| Schematic | Hairline technical drawings of the VM: boxes, a bus, a dimension line, UPPER callouts, a drawing number. | Home `the core`; docs |
| Scope trace | Bots' process counts as phosphor traces on a graticule, on the theme's panel, in the bots' hues (glowing in a dark theme, darkened to ink in a light one). | Home `fight` |
| Hex band | A core dump whose lit bytes, the imp's `A5 90`, spell a word in a 5 × 7 face; the dim bytes around them spell Pedram's bio once through in ASCII, `00` between words. | Home, over the tour |

Rules:

- **Art is not content.** Every drawing is `aria-hidden`; the text beside it says what it shows. Text inside an SVG drawing may use `--text-dim`.
- **Nothing moves.** A plate draws once, and again only on a resize or a theme change.
- **After the paint.** The drawings are one chunk (`src/art/index.tsx`), loaded once the page has painted and gone idle; a page renders a stand-in (`art/Plate.tsx` for a plate, `art/lazy.tsx` for the others), and its box holds the space before, so nothing shifts.
- **Screenshots** on the home page are the docs' (`public/docs-shots`), small, framed as a window with its `ASM BOTS // PAGE` bar, lazy, and each opens its page. Each is taken in every theme and shows in the reader's (`app/shots.ts`; `DOCS_SHOTS=1 bunx playwright test e2e/docs-shots.spec.ts` retakes them all).
- **A section's banner** sits at the right end of its page intro (`PageIntro`'s `art`, an `IntroArt`), from `md` on, 320 × 168 px (the docs home banner's height), fading in from the text's side. The intro heads its lead with a bold line (`PageAbout.title`): three short sentences, as the docs home's `Learn the machine. Write a bot. Take the hill.` One scene a section: every page of the section shows the same one. The arena's setup loads its banner after the page, behind a placeholder of the same box: `/arena` is at the edge of its budget.
- **The footer** ends every page that scrolls. The arena's fight fills the screen, and its footer waits below the fold. The editor and embeds fill the screen and have none.
- Empty states stay text (§4): no art there.

### Add a plate

1. **The scene.** A `Scene` (`src/art/dither.ts`) gives each cell a tone, 0 to 1, or `BRIGHT`; measure in plate heights (`aspect(grid)`) so it keeps its shape on any width. A section banner goes in `src/art/banners.ts` and keeps its subject at the right end; any other in `src/art/scenes.ts`.
2. **Its name.** Add it to `SCENES` in `src/art/index.tsx`.
3. **The page.** A banner: `<PageIntro art={<IntroArt name="…" />} />`. Any other: `<Plate name="…" />` (`art/Plate.tsx`) in a box with a fixed size and `overflow-hidden`. 2 px cells (`cell={2}`) under about 200 px.
4. **Its test.** Add the scene and its grid to the coverage case in `apps/web/test/art.test.ts` (something drawn, room left), and a banner to `keep their subject at the right end`.
5. **The budget.** `bun run bundle`. On a page within 1 KB of its budget (`/arena`), load the art there with `lazy()` behind a placeholder of the same box, as `ArenaSetup.tsx` does: CI measures about 0.2 KB over a local build.

Review it in two themes, a dark one and `paper`. Canvases are masked in the theme screenshots, but a box that changes a page's layout changes its baselines: remake them (apps/web README, "Screenshots").
