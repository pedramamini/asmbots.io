/**
 * Hill jobs (PRODUCT_SPEC §5): a submission fights each entry of a duel hill, one match an alarm.
 * Then `submitToHill` ranks the field from the stored results, playing nothing, and the new board
 * goes to D1 over the hill's revision as it was read, in one batch with the submission's status,
 * score, and rank. Other submissions run beside it, so the board can change first: the job then
 * reads it again, and fights any entry that is new to it.
 *
 * The entries' matches with each other come from D1: an entry fights every other when it comes
 * onto the hill, so the latest match of a pair is the one the hill ranks the pair by. A bot
 * version already on the hill is refused, so no challenge of one leaves a later match behind.
 *
 * Each submission is a Glicko-2 rating period (`rateMatches`): the challenger's matches rate it
 * and every entry it fought. The board write carries the new ratings (`ratings`, and each entry's
 * `hill_entries.rating`), the challenge's events (`hill_history`), and the king's reign
 * (`reign.ts`) in its batch.
