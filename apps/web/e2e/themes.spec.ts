/**
 * The three main routes (`/`, `/arena`, `/editor`) in all nine themes, against the production build
 * and the seeded e2e Worker (PRODUCT_SPEC §11): each compared with its committed baseline in
 * `e2e/__snapshots__/themes.spec.ts/`, 0.2% of the pixels at most may differ. A first visit, under
 * reduced motion, so the home demo is a still and nothing moves. The main hill's standings and
 * matches come from `e2e/fixtures/` (the launch seed's, as other specs submit to the hill). What
 * changes from run to run is masked: the ticker (live feed, clock), the version stamp, every
 * canvas, the home demo (its bots and seed are random), and the next championship (a date).
 *
 * Baselines are per platform (`-darwin`, `-linux`): fonts and GPU raster differ between them. CI's
 * are the Playwright image's; make them with the commands in apps/web/guide/e2e.md ("Screenshots").
