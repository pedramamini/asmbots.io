 * storage, emptied, migrated, and given the launch seed (the hills, the roster on them) at each
 * start, so `bun run dev` can run beside it. A `Runner` waits `RUNNER_ALARM_DELAY_MS` between its
 * matches, so a spec can watch a submission's progress. `--local-upstream` keeps the Worker's
 * request URLs on localhost: without it `wrangler dev` gives them the production route's host
 * (`asmbots.io`), so fake sign-in (localhost only) and the same-origin check on writes refuse.
 * `--local` leaves out the remote bindings (Workers AI): CI has no Cloudflare login.
