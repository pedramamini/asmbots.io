/**
 * The arena Worker's protocol (ARCHITECTURE §6): the requests the main thread sends
 * `arena.worker.ts`, and the messages it sends back. A message's typed arrays are transferred,
 * never copied.
 *
 * Each request that moves the battle gets exactly one `frame`, or an `error` in its place: `load`,
 * `setRound`, `step`, `seek`, and `requestFrame`. `play`, `pause`, and `speed` get no answer, only
 * an `error` when they fail. `loaded` comes before the frame of a `load` or a `setRound`, and
 * `ended` after the frame that ends the battle. `match` runs a whole match headless, beside the
 * battle and without touching it (the editor's `test vs`), and gets one `match`, or an `error`.
 *
 * A load is a match of one or more rounds (ISA §5.5): round i places the bots in a rotated order
 * with the seed plus i, as `@asmbots/tourney` scores it. The messages name bots by their place in
 * the load all the same, whatever order they fight in: a bot's index, its owner tag (index + 1),
 * and so its hue stay the same from round to round. Only `EndedMessage.result`, the engine's
 * own, lists the bots in fighting order.
