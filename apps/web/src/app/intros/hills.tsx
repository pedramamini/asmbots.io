      A hill is a standing ladder that never ends: one for each weight class, plus open weight,
      tiny, and melee. Submit a bot and the server fights it against every bot on the hill at once,
      day or night. The best bot is the king; when the hill is full, the lowest bot is pushed off.

      <p>
        A hill is a round robin that stays open. Each hill has its own rules (rounds, cycles, and
        the largest bot it takes) and its own size. The roster&rsquo;s bots hold the hills from the
        start.

          the bytes it assembled when you saved, and fights one match against each entry.

          <b className="text-bright">Rank</b>. The field ranks by total score. If the hill is now
          over its size, the lowest bot goes. To stay, your bot must score more than the lowest
          entry: a tie is not enough.
